It seems like you might be referring to the **SDG14**, which is actually one of the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, rather than a specific sensor or technology. 

### **SDG 14: Life Below Water**

SDG 14 aims to **conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources** for sustainable development. It recognizes the importance of the ocean as a source of food, livelihood, and ecosystem services, and addresses the need for sustainable practices to ensure the long-term health and productivity of marine environments.

#### **Key Targets and Indicators of SDG 14:**

1. **14.1**: By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
2. **14.2**: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts.
3. **14.3**: Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification.
4. **14.4**: Effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and destructive fishing practices.
5. **14.5**: Conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
6. **14.6**: Prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing.
7. **14.7**: Increase the economic benefits to small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources.
8. **14.a**: Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity, and transfer marine technology to developing countries.
9. **14.b**: Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.
10. **14.c**: Implement and enforce international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, in order to regulate and protect marine biodiversity.

#### **Why It Matters:**
- **Oceans** cover about **71% of the Earth's surface** and play a crucial role in **regulating climate**, producing oxygen, and providing food.
- **Overfishing**, **pollution**, and **climate change** are putting immense pressure on ocean ecosystems, threatening marine biodiversity, the livelihoods of millions, and global food security.
  
#### **Actions for SDG 14:**
- Reducing plastic waste and marine debris.
- Sustainable fisheries management and reducing bycatch.
- Protecting critical marine habitats such as coral reefs and mangroves.
- Expanding marine protected areas (MPAs).
- Enhancing international cooperation on marine research and conservation.

In summary, **SDG 14** emphasizes the importance of preserving and protecting the worldâ€™s oceans and seas, ensuring their health and sustainability for future generations.
